Also this problem could be noticeable by authors using LaTeX.\n\nDoing Select Paragraph <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌥P</kbd> again will select the comment as well."},{"commit":"54b39a5876a57305be2ef9f1ee6d49c4dd817939","date":"2016-03-31T07:52:39-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Include leading whitespace when reformatting comments","body":"Due to changes made to grammars a while back we no longer scope the whitespace preceding a comment as a comment but rather punctuation.whitespace. This change includes the whitespace in the command to better reformat the comments."},{"commit":"01db29d6595f09067169032e65232b4a5792c7a9","date":"2015-09-08T02:02:56-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Revert: Don&#39;t enable spell checking for strings in embedded code.","body":"This was causing more confusion from people desiring spell checking than it solved for those originally requesting the feature, removed for clarity. It can easy be re-added by those wanting this behavior.\n\nThis reverts commit e3c3e64fbe43f93e24a002e6aa052646525a1faa."},{"commit":"21f1a1f7fe47bb1cc6cef650cfc4cdcb3ee2c3b2","date":"2015-07-30T15:11:48+03:00","author":"Tõnis Simo","summary":"Support multiple carets when toggle word cases"},{"commit":"f1af1fec56d49a360ea79735eb5aa7890cf8dd04","date":"2015-03-26T22:17:41+07:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Make Insert Block Comment work with discontinuous selections","body":"This only works when none of the discontinuous selections contain newlines."},{"commit":"e8b4aa3b3712b96c5f387a235d5ee023d739001f","date":"2014-08-16T02:12:52-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Use latest version of ruby rather than the shim","body":"This allows ruby to correctly match unicode characters when 2.0 is present.
