Calling ::Process.setsid starting new session and making the forked process\n   a process group leader.\n\n2. Using ::Process.kill(&quot;-SIG&quot;) prefixing signal with &quot;-&quot; which effectively\n   sends signal to process group.\n\nNow TextMate is finally able to properly tear down `go run` and similar wrapper\nprocesses."},{"commit":"a48fa7f545068d4861fed968e0bfc897d41e52d6","date":"2015-12-02T01:29:33-06:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Add shim for Ruby 2.x","body":"This script ensures that scripts are run with the predictable system supplied version of ruby rather than a user-installed future version.
