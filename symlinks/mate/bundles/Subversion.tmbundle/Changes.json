The previous workaround became very visible on Yosemite, a hair space isn&#39;t absolutely invisible but almost so."},{"commit":"00ab2df517c6949e7eb3b2edce1ac33583779cf5","date":"2014-10-21T17:44:40-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Remove usage of event library","body":"This corrects a issue with a missing library on Yosemite."},{"commit":"df90fe9b46355c821049195f5cccb6058060d9cf","date":"2014-08-28T00:11:59+08:00","author":"Yuan","summary":"Correct order of params when using TM_SVN_DIFF_CMD to diff urls"},{"commit":"a2fa476511e6cbe34c83db832b733c5574ada3a2","date":"2014-06-18T21:59:53+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Use TM_MATE environment variable (instead of raw ‘mate’)"},{"commit":"4d5e480fcaf022a7493d7a18a9b0da20a4e95fd5","date":"2014-06-18T21:43:01+02:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Let Subversion → Checkout fallback on home folder","body":"If TM_DIRECTORY is unset then TM_FILEPATH would also be unset, causing an exception (dirname being called with nil)."},{"commit":"9806dbe60135b970737a8f6a44df8fc5ed4c0c91","date":"2014-04-11T12:31:39+07:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Let actions in status window call the proper scripts","body":"Previously revert, remove, and commit would all fail, fixes textmate/subversion.tmbundle#12\n\nIt seems that the status window code is from the old bundle, prior to the major refactoring done, and while new scripts had been created for the actions, no one was actually calling them.\n\nI also removed setting ‘LC_CTYPE’ as that should no longer be an issue, additionally we now recommend calling ‘mate’ via the TM_MATE environment variable."},{"commit":"34a545749f369d91b76ca329cc63c7b2f691babe","date":"2014-04-11T12:40:47+07:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Revert &quot;Fix for the diff action in the commit window&quot;","body":"This reverts commit 124b963bf3226277a5973f4e5d2707976a215165."},{"commit":"124b963bf3226277a5973f4e5d2707976a215165","date":"2014-02-24T15:11:58-06:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Fix for the diff action in the commit window","body":"Starting with mate 2.5 it will not read from standard input if the TM_DOCUMENT_UUID environment variable is set. This is unfortunate for commands launched by TextMate (where the variable is set) that use mate to pass data to TextMate (via mate’s stdin).\n\nThis fix is provisional until a new version of mate gets released."},{"commit":"74803ce046e930bc1a510e6b83273ce08a5c5045","date":"2014-02-21T20:54:54+07:00","author":"Allan Odgaard","summary":"Improve the “Find Next Conflict” macro bound to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃|</kbd>","body":"Pressing <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃|</kbd> when already at the start of a merge conflict will now find the next merge conflict (previously it would find the merge conflict “at the caret”)."},{"commit":"fdbe51129875c8913d91e60c29f9f3231db82cf3","date":"2013-10-24T05:45:15-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Use 1.8 of ruby in a few missed places","body":"Fixes #10."},{"commit":"90be5e900d87451b9951f041722b95208361c07c","date":"2013-03-17T03:46:41-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Pass nil instead of an empty string if TM_SVN_DIFF_CMD is unset","body":"Passing an empty string broke the ability to diff a single file and it rather diffed the entire project.

Presently the only thing it does is to append a ‘@’ to the filename if the filename already contains one. This is required because subversion cuts any suffix matching /@[^@]*$/ and treats that as shorthand for the revision argument (-r).\n\nIdeally svn would have an option to disable this behavior."},{"commit":"12b1272b950c238a362f8f093b01e10e82846e9c","date":"2013-03-06T23:38:39+08:00","author":"Yuan","summary":"Allow setting TM_SVN_DIFF_CMD to use a external diff command","body":"Fixes #7."}],"name":"Subversion"}
