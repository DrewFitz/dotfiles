This reverts c1077db238408950ed4c53b258215137eb6f3492 from pull request #20."},{"commit":"32af606a9e4e56707d1be4569947a516aa20bc64","date":"2014-11-01T00:44:18-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Improve reliability of tab creation","body":"We now make sure that Terminal is active before using the tab creation shortcut.
